## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run the code you will need a framework to run Jupyter Notebooks. This is, for example, included in the Anaconda distribution for Python. The code should run out of the box with python versions > 3.9.13.

The code expects data in a folder called "data", which needs to be placed in the directory where you run the code. You can download  latests datasets from [Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). Chose a city/region and place the "listings.csv.gz" in the data folder.
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This code was created in the course of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this first project we were asked to analyze a dataset of our own choice. As a proud Austrian, I picked a data set related to Austria. I selected an Airbnb dataset regarding the available listings in Vienna and tried to answer the following questions:

1) How many Airbnb listings are offered for Vienna, and how do they split up in private rooms, entire homes/apartments, hotel rooms and shared rooms? What is the price distribution across the room types?
2) How many hosts offer their listings on Airbnb? Are there more hosts which offer a single listing than hosts which offer multiple listings on Airbnb?
3) Are there any obvious differences in the listings attributes (e.g. prices, review ratings), comparing the single host listings with the listing from hosts with multiple offers?
## File and Folders Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
**airbnb_data_analysis.ipynb**: This is the file you need to run.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The results were published on Medium. You can access the blog post with [this link](https://medium.com/@zengerlet/airbnb-in-vienna-private-or-professional-hosts-thats-the-question-11b1a20a96de).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
I would like to give credit to Airbnb for the nice and clean data set. The licensing details can be found on the [Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
